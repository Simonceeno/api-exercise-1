# Random developer joke generator

**About this project**

This is a responsive random joke generator about developers.
I used HTML, CSS, JS and I needed an external APIs to obtain a list of random developer jokes: thanks, [David Kats](https://github.com/15Dkatz)! 

Just click the button, read and laugh! (Audio on recommended)
